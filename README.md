# QuickFrame
QuickFrame is a lightweight browser extension that enhances your browsing experience by allowing you to preview links in a draggable, resizable iframe. Hover over any link for 2 seconds, and a sleek iframe appears beside itâ€”keeping the link visible while offering a live preview of the content. Perfect for multitasking, research, and quick browsing!
